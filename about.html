        <h1>YELLLOO!!</h1>
        <p>
          Hey there!! I’m Kashish. Taking this first step takes immense courage, and I honor that.
          And full disclosure, I’ve navigated my own stuff to stand here. So, when I say -
          "there might be moments you want to hide yourself completely in this room.
          But I promise you, I’ll still see every single bit of you." I mean it.
          The most important thing? When that happens, it’s absolutely going to be safe and okay.
        </p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>The truth is, my story started long before I understood anything. I lost my mom when I was just 16 days old... I didn’t even get to know her, and still — I missed her...</p>
      <p>I grew up in a big joint family. There were always people around, a lot of love, and even more pampering. But I never really felt safe... That silence turned into anger, frustration, distance.</p>
      <p>Academically, my cousins were brilliant. And I was just… trying. But no matter how much I pushed myself... it was easier to fake it than to feel the constant shame of failing.</p>
      <p>Food became my comfort. My escape. I gained weight, struggled with obesity... My body became something I felt disconnected from — a source of shame, not home.</p>
      <p>There were other things too... I was loud, funny, dramatic — but inside, I was shut down. I craved connection, but mistook attention for closeness.</p>
      <p>I held so much inside... Then one day, a friend looked at me and gently said, “Why don’t you try therapy?”</p>
      <p>Eventually I went. And in that room, I was allowed to just be. I could talk about things I never told anyone... Like my pain made sense. Like I made sense.</p>
      <p>But little by little, I started coming back to myself... I found a deeper connection to who I really am.</p>
      <p>That’s why I created <strong>WithKashish</strong>. Not because I have all the answers. But because I know what it feels like to live with unspoken pain. <strong>WithKashish</strong> is a space where you don’t have to perform... You’re allowed to just be. Exactly as you are.</p>
