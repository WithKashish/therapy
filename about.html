        <p>
          Hey there!! I’m Kashish. Taking this first step takes immense courage, and I honor that.
          And full disclosure, I’ve navigated my own stuff to stand here. So, when I say -
          "there might be moments you want to hide yourself completely in this room.
          But I promise you, I’ll still see every single bit of you." I mean it.
          The most important thing? When that happens, it’s absolutely going to be safe and okay.

    <h2>My Journey</h2>

    <p>The truth is, my story started long before I understood anything. I lost my mom when I was just 16 days old. I didn’t even get to know her, and still — I missed her. It’s a strange kind of pain, missing someone you’ve never met. It’s like something was always missing inside me, and I didn’t know what or why.</p>

    <p>I grew up in a big joint family. There were always people around, a lot of love, and even more pampering. But I never really felt safe. You know that kind of safety where you can break down, cry, fall apart in someone’s arms? I didn’t have that. So very early on, I learned to hold it all in. By the time I was five, people were already calling me “strong.” Telling me I didn’t need anyone. And slowly, I started believing it. At home, no one talked openly about what really happened. I was told things about my mother and family that weren’t true. I carried those stories like they were mine, until I got old enough to realize — a lot of it was lies. But by then, the damage was done. I didn’t have the courage to question anything. I didn’t want to shake things up. So I stayed quiet. And that silence turned into anger, frustration, distance. I avoided talking about it because… what was the point?</p>

    <p>Academically, my cousins were brilliant. And I was just… trying. But no matter how much I pushed myself, it never felt good enough. Eventually, I gave up trying the “right” way. I started cheating in school just to get by. Not because I didn’t care — but because I cared too much and didn’t know how to deal with feeling like a disappointment. It was easier to fake it than to feel the constant shame of failing.</p>

    <p>Food became my comfort. My escape. It was the one thing I could control. Or maybe the one thing I let control me. I gained weight, struggled with obesity, and dealt with endless comments from people who had no idea how much pain I was already in. My body became something I felt disconnected from — a source of shame, not home.</p>

    <p>There were other things too. Feelings about my body, about myself, that felt too personal to talk about. Early desires, curiosities I didn’t know what to do with. I felt ashamed. So I just… acted on things instead of understanding them. I’d tell myself, “kya hi hoga?” — what’s the worst that can happen? It was easier than sitting with all the confusion. That phrase became my way of avoiding. But it didn’t help. It just pushed everything deeper.</p>

    <p>Even with friends, I had walls up. I was loud, funny, dramatic — but inside, I was shut down. I craved connection, but I kept mistaking attention for closeness. I didn’t know how to let people in. Or maybe I just didn’t trust that anyone would stay.</p>

    <p>I held so much inside — sadness, confusion, anger. But I couldn’t show it. I didn’t know how. I didn’t even cry properly for years. I got so used to being “fine” that I forgot what it felt like to actually feel. Then one day, a friend looked at me and gently said, “Why don’t you try therapy?” I shrugged it off at first.</p>

    <p>But eventually, I went. And in that room, for the first time in my life, I was allowed to just be. I could talk about things I never told anyone. About the lies, the guilt, the secrets, the rage, the body shame, the numbness. There were no quick fixes. My therapist just sat there, listening, really listening — like my pain made sense. Like I made sense. It changed something in me.</p>

    <p>Not overnight. Healing never works like that. I slipped. I numbed out again. I pushed people away. I still found it hard to accept love — not because I didn’t want it, but because I didn’t know how to let it in. I’d built my whole life around being strong and self-sufficient. Letting someone care felt terrifying.</p>

    <p>But little by little, I started coming back to myself. I faced truths I’d buried. I confronted the stories I was raised with. I stopped pretending. I allowed myself to feel — all of it. The anger, the shame, the fear, the longing. And somehow, through all that, I found a deeper connection to who I really am.</p>

    <p>That’s why I created <strong>WithKashish</strong>. Not because I have all the answers. Not because I’ve “figured it out.” But because I know what it feels like to live with unspoken pain. I know what it’s like to feel alone in a room full of people. To not know where you belong. To crave connection but be terrified of it at the same time.</p>

    <p><strong>WithKashish</strong> is a space where you don’t have to perform. Where you don’t have to hide your sadness, your shame, or your silence. Where you’re allowed to just be. Exactly as you are.</p>
