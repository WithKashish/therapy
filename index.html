<section class="about-section">
  <h2>Welcome to WithKashish</h2>
  <p>
    You know that exhausting whisper – ‘Log kya kahenge?’ It tells you to hide stretch marks, pluck facial hair, or pretend dark patches don’t exist. Maybe you fake orgasms, bury desires feeling ‘wrong’ or ‘dirty’—like wanting to be dominated in sex, or exploring something ‘unconventional’. Perhaps you’re always the ‘strong one,’ quietly crumbling, or trapped in a relationship you desperately want to leave.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might battle constant anxiety, feel like an imposter, or struggle with hidden resentment. Maybe you’re queer, polyamorous, or gender non-conforming, exhausted by hiding who you are. You’re constantly performing, suffocating in a mold, living with a daily weight no one sees—a weight that comes out as outbursts, people-pleasing, or numbness. This space is for that heavy burden you carry in silence. You’re not alone, and here, you don’t have to carry it anymore.
  </p>

  <h3>What We Do Here?</h3>
  <p>
    At <strong>WithKashish</strong>, I’m not here to ‘fix’ you, because you’re not broken. We’ll gently explore parts you’ve run from, expressing them not just with words, but through drama, art, and music. I can’t promise everything will be ‘figured out,’ but I can promise a deeper, more honest connection with yourself. This means living authentically: speaking your truth, choosing joy over obligation, feeling truly at home in your own skin. It’s about shedding heavy weight and finally experiencing the freedom of being entirely, unapologetically you.
  </p>

  <h3>Who I Work With?</h3>
  <p>
    ‘Is this really for me?’ If any of these resonate, you’re in the right place. I hold space for the things most people are afraid to say out loud:
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you’ve spoken it before or never dared to, it’s safe here. Over the last few years, I’ve had the honor of walking alongside 400+ client sessions — across identities, age groups, and life stories — and holding 15+ raw, healing-centered workshops across India. Each one showed me how universal our pain can be… and how uniquely each person deserves to be met in it.
  </p>

  <ul class="about-list">
    <li><strong>Overwhelming emotions</strong> — rage, grief, shame, guilt, jealousy, numbness</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional suppression</strong> — feeling shut down, disconnected, or like your feelings are “too much”</li>
    <li><strong>Taboo desires</strong> — sexual fantasies, kink curiosity, intrusive thoughts, emotional cravings that feel “wrong”</li>
    <li><strong>Inner conflict</strong> — feeling split between who you are and who you’re “supposed” to be</li>
    <li><strong>Inner child wounds</strong> — unmet needs, abandonment pain, feeling unlovable or unsafe</li>
    <li><strong>Fear of intimacy or abandonment</strong> — constantly chasing or pushing away love</li>
    <li><strong>Chronic self-doubt</strong> — imposter syndrome, insecurity, low self-worth, comparison</li>
    <li><strong>Perfectionism & people-pleasing</strong> — hiding your truth to be accepted</li>
    <li><strong>Body image & sexual shame</strong> — struggling with feeling desirable, lovable, or comfortable in your own skin</li>
